#+OPTIONS: toc:nil timestamp:nil

* About
  *Diagonal* is a command line toolkit to solve a problem which your favorite program defines.
  For example it can be used for:
  - getting descriptive statistics such as mean/median/mode with your program producing a sample
  - finding a root of an equation your program defines
#  - solving the inverse problem of a forward problem your program defines
  - calculating a fixed point of a function your program defines
  - detecting a cycle of a fuction your program defines
  as well as
#  - cluster analysis
  - decoding a [[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3284][VCDIFF]] file
